## 📖 Description
* An **AI-powered optimization system** designed to minimize emergency response times in complex urban environments.
* Uses **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to train a fleet of emergency vehicles for a cooperative dispatch strategy.
* Operates within a **high-fidelity traffic simulation** built with [SUMO](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) and real-world map data from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/).

## 🎯 Introduction

### Background
In densely populated cities, **every second counts** during an emergency. Traditional dispatch systems often use a simple "closest-unit" logic, which is suboptimal as it fails to account for dynamic variables like **real-time traffic** and the likelihood of future incidents.

### Motivation
This project is driven by the potential of modern AI to solve **complex, real-world logistical challenges** with a significant social impact. We aim to apply advanced **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** techniques to create a smarter, faster, and more efficient emergency response network.

## ✨ Features
* **Dynamic Traffic Simulation:** Simulates realistic, unpredictable traffic patterns using the **SUMO engine**.
* **Predictive Hotspot Modeling:** Identifies areas with a high probability of future incidents for **proactive positioning**.
* **Cooperative AI Agents:** Employs MARL to teach independent agents a **coordinated dispatch strategy**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Simulation:** SUMO
* **Core Language:** Python
* **AI/ML Libraries:** Ray RLlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas
* **Simulation Bridge:** Traci
