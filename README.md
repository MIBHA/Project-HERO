##  Abstract

This project introduces **HERO (Heuristic Emergency Response Optimizer)**, an advanced simulation and optimization system designed to minimize emergency response times in urban environments. Leveraging a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach, HERO trains a fleet of emergency vehicles to learn a cooperative dispatch and positioning strategy. The system operates within a high-fidelity traffic simulation built with SUMO and real-world map data from OpenStreetMap.

The primary problem addressed is the inefficiency of traditional, static dispatch systems, which often fail to account for dynamic factors like real-time traffic and predicted incident hotspots. By creating intelligent, adaptive agents, Project HERO demonstrates a significant improvement in response logistics, directly contributing to the "golden hour" of emergency care and ultimately aiming to save more lives.

##  Introduction

### Background
In densely populated urban areas, every second counts during a medical emergency or crisis. The effectiveness of emergency response services is heavily dependent on their ability to reach an incident location as quickly as possible. However, existing dispatch systems often rely on simple heuristics, such as assigning the geographically closest unit. This simplistic approach is often suboptimal, as it fails to consider dynamic variables like unpredictable traffic patterns, the availability of other units, or the likelihood of future incidents in nearby areas. This can lead to delayed arrivals and potentially tragic outcomes.

### Motivation
The motivation for Project HERO stems from the potential of modern AI to solve complex, real-world logistical challenges with a significant social impact. The recent advancements in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provide a powerful new toolkit for training independent agents to learn complex, cooperative strategies that surpass human-programmed heuristics. This project was built to explore and demonstrate the tangible application of these advanced AI techniques to create a smarter, faster, and more efficient emergency response network.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1.  **Build** a realistic, dynamic simulation of an urban environment using SUMO and real-world geospatial data.
2.  **Develop** a predictive model that can identify incident hotspots based on historical and contextual data.
3.  **Implement** and train a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where AI agents, representing emergency vehicles, learn an optimal dispatch policy.
4.  **Benchmark** the performance of the trained MARL agents against traditional dispatch methods and demonstrate a quantifiable reduction in average response times.
