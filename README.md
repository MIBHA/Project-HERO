# Project HERO (Heuristic Emergency Response Optimizer)

## ðŸ“– Description
* An **AI-powered optimization system** designed to minimize emergency response times in complex urban environments.
* Uses **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** to train a fleet of emergency vehicles for cooperative dispatch.
* Operates within a **high-fidelity traffic simulation** built with SUMO and real-world map data from OpenStreetMap.

## âœ¨ Features
* **Dynamic Traffic Simulation:** Simulates realistic, unpredictable traffic patterns using the **SUMO engine**.
* **Predictive Hotspot Modeling:** Identifies areas with a high probability of future incidents to enable **proactive positioning**.
* **Cooperative AI Agents:** Employs MARL to teach independent agents a **coordinated dispatch strategy** that outperforms simple heuristics.

## ðŸ“œ The Problem & Our Solution
* **Problem:** Traditional dispatch systems are inefficient, often assigning the closest unit without considering **real-time traffic** or future needs.
* **Solution:** HERO develops a **learned, adaptive policy** that dynamically positions and dispatches vehicles, significantly reducing response times.

## ðŸŽ¯ Applications
* **Emergency Medical Services:** Optimizing ambulance dispatch to **reduce arrival times** for critical patients.
* **Fire Departments:** Coordinating fire truck deployment for **faster response** to incidents.
* **Disaster Management:** Managing emergency fleets during large-scale crises like earthquakes or floods.

## ðŸ”§ Installation
1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Project-HERO.git`
2.  Install SUMO: Follow the [Official SUMO Installation Guide](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html).
3.  Install Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run the simulation: `python src/run_simulation.py`

## ðŸ“Š Project Phases
1.  **Phase 1: Simulation Environment:** Built a controllable, realistic city simulation using **SUMO and OpenStreetMap**.
2.  **Phase 2: Predictive Modeling:** Developed a model to **forecast incident hotspots** using synthetic data and clustering algorithms.
3.  **Phase 3: Reinforcement Learning:** Will implement **MARL agents** to learn and execute an optimal dispatch policy.
